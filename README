wr-fixes
=======

This layer provides the fixes to other components of the system
(oe-core, meta-yocto, meta-selinux, etc....)


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the version of openembedded-core supplied with Wind
River Linux.

This layer also enhances a few items from other Wind River Linux layers. If you
choose not to use the other layers, you may need to add the following to your
local.conf:

BB_DANGLINGAPPENDS_WARNONLY = "1"

Otherwise, the system will error out on bbappend files that reference recipes
that do not exist.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the wr-fixes layer
-----------------------------------
This layer should be added to the bblayers.conf file.
